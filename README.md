Mapbox is a powerful tool for building map-based applications, and this project uses it to create a Google Maps-like experience. The app fetches data from Mapbox to display a real-time world map and integrates the browser's geolocation API along with Mapbox plugins for enhanced functionality.

Features:
### Interactive Real-Time Map: 
Navigate through a world map with zooming and panning.
### Shortest Route: 
Find the shortest path between two destinations.
### Transport Modes: 
See estimated time for various modes of transport (Traffic, Driving, Cycling, Walking).
### Geolocation: 
Displays the user's current location using the browser's geolocation API.

This project provides a simple yet powerful map navigation tool with real-time data and route planning.
